# reddit-openai-bot
searches for strings in reddit comments then replies using openai or randomly chosen response
<br>
<br>The point of this bot is to give ai generated responses to reddit users.  
<br>Because the openai api is free to use for a finite amount of tokens, I've
<br>added a simple way to randomly pick from a list of pre curated responses.
